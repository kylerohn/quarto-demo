These are some of my hobbies

## Programming

I'm not just saying this, I really like to code. This comes from the fact I really like solving puzzles, and every programming problem is just a complicated puzzle to solve.

## Weightlifting

I enjoy spending time in the gym. It keeps me feeling and looking good, and it is a great way to blow off some steam when I've had a stressful day


## Video Games

My favorite video game is Rocket League, of which I have more than 2500 hours playing. I'm not as good as I should be for that amount of time though.
